                            <h2 class="border-bottom border-danger border-3 pb-3 mb-4">The Legend of Red-Haired Shanks</h2>
                            <p class="lead">Shanks started his journey as a young apprentice on the ship of Gol D. Roger, the Pirate King himself. Back then, he was just a kid with big dreams and an even bigger future ahead of him.</p>
                            
                            <h3 class="mt-4 mb-3">Family Legacy</h3>
                            <p>What most people don't know is that Shanks comes from an incredibly powerful bloodline. His father is St. Garling Figarland, a Knight of God. Shanks has a twin brother named Shamrock, who currently serves as a Knight of God. It's a complicated family history that Shanks doesn't talk about much.</p>

                            <h3 class="mt-4 mb-3">The Lost Years</h3>
                            <p>After Roger's execution, Shanks felt completely lost. Losing his captain hit him harder than anyone realized. During this dark period, he ended up making some choices he's not proud of. There's speculation he had dealings with the Five Elders - even formed a pact with them. Some believe he was the one who let Fisher Tiger escape, though he's never confirmed it.</p>

                            <p>For a while, he even walked the path toward becoming a Knight of God himself. But that life didn't sit right with him. He had this mark on his arm, connected to the Five Elders - a constant reminder of obligations he never wanted. When that sea monster attacked Luffy, losing his arm wasn't just an accident. He needed to be free of that mark, and sometimes you gotta make tough choices.</p>

                            <h3 class="mt-4 mb-3">Building His Own Path</h3>
                            <p>After Roger's death, Shanks eventually pulled himself together and formed his own crew - the Red Hair Pirates. They've been sailing together for decades now, building a reputation that makes even the World Government nervous. He's not the type to go looking for trouble, but when it finds him, things get serious real quick.</p>

                                <h3 class="alert-heading">The Straw Hat Promise</h3>
                                <p class="mb-0">Years ago, Shanks met a young boy named Monkey D. Luffy in a small village called Foosha. That encounter changed everything. When a sea monster attacked Luffy, Shanks lost his left arm saving the kid's life. Before leaving, he gave Luffy his treasured straw hat - the same one Roger once wore - and told him to return it when he became a great pirate.</p>
                            </div>

                            <h3 class="mt-4 mb-3">Power and Influence</h3>
                            <p>Don't let his laid-back attitude fool you. Shanks commands respect from pirates and Marines alike. His mastery of all three types of Haki is unmatched, and he's one of the few people who can walk into Marineford and have everyone stop what they're doing to listen.</p>

                            <p class="mb-0">The Red Hair Pirates are considered the most well-balanced crew among the Yonko. Every single member is incredibly powerful, making them a force that nobody wants to mess with unless absolutely necessary.</p>
